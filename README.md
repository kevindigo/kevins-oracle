## Background/history

While playing solo RPGs, I found myself bouncing between various online and offline tools. This page is my attempt to have everything I need in one place. 

The systems I have used for solo RPG play, and which I think should mostly be supported by the tools included, are:

- [Shadowdark](https://www.thearcanelibrary.com/pages/shadowdark)
- [Microlite20](https://microlite20.fandom.com/wiki/Microlite20_Wiki)
- [Tricube Tales](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/294202/tricube-tales)
- My own unpublished RPG design, StarFlit
